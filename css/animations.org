With CSS animation you can animate HTML elements. Some browsers need specific prefixes (-webkit-) to understand the animation properties. An animation lets an element change from one style to another.

To specify an animation, you need keyframes, which hold a certain style of an element at a certain time.

In this example the animation will last 4 seconds and will gradually change the background-color from red to yellow:

 /* The animation code */
@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
